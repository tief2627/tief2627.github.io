			<h2>Concept</h2>
			<p>Composition is the organization or grouping of the different parts of a work of art so as to achieve a unified whole.<br>
Although typographic composition utilizes the same basic compositional
concepts that are part of all visual arts, there are unique ways that typography
relates to each of these concepts. By forming relationships between the
elements, and incorporating visual concepts in abstract ways, a new and more
open relationship with typography is achieved.
Shown on the following pages, the exploration of typographic composition
started with simple elements--three letterforms--and became a process of
identifying abstract concepts as they became visualized. Additional elements
were added each week, and new relationships evolved as we explored
positive/negative and texture image use.</p>

			<h2>Letterforms</h2>
			<p>These compositions feature three letters from the alphabet, set in any of the following typefaces:

Garamond, Times Roman, Century, Baskerville and/or Bodoni. By

using size, scale, spacial relationships, bleeds and positioning as the variables, I created six

compositions using only the three letterforms. The final compositions are 15cm x 15cm

(standard format throughout).</p>

			<h2>Letterforms and words</h2>
			<p>Keeping the three letters from the previous assignment, I have now included three words. The words do not

have to have any particular meaning or association with each other. Each letter and word is set in one of the

following typefaces: Garamond, Times Roman, Century, and/or Bodoni. Using only

the three letters and three words, I created the following compositions.</p>

			<h2>Letterforms, words and text </h2>
			<p>Starting with the same three letters and three words from the previous assignments, I am now adding

some text. I am setting the text in one of the approved typefaces from before,

adjusting the leading, column width, type size, etc. to achieve different results. As abstract compositions, it

is not necessary that the text or other typographic elements be readable.</p>

			<h2>Texture and positive / negative</h2>
			<p>Positive/negative is the relationship between figure and ground. Texture is the ability to render type in ways

other than just hard edge black and white. Combining these two allows me to define type in unusual and unique

ways-challenging me to see it differently. Starting with the same three letters, three words and text used in the

last assignments, I incorporated positive/negative and texture as major design components.
